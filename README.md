# A-handbook-for-fermionic-n-iDM

To facilitate phenomenological studies, we developed a Mathematica Handbook for fermionic (not-so-)inelastic dark matter, which includes analytic expressions for decay widths and branching ratios of all states in this effective model, as well as 3-body decay amplitudes. Users can specify  the coefficient values for their concrete models or simply choose the already implemented coeffients for niDM (arXiv:2405.08081) and i2DM (arXiv:2201.08409).

The handbook also includes differential and total cross sections for dark sector production in e^+e^- collisions. While a Monte Carlo event generator for collider signals such as mono-photon events and displaced vertex searches can be found in https://github.com/gdvgarcia/niDMatEEcolliders.
